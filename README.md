# GCOMMANDS EXAMPLE BOT

An optimized version of the discord bot with a sharder programmed with [gcommands](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gcommands).


# SETTING-UP

- open the file "example.env" and replace in it "your discord bot token" to your discord bot token which you can find in the [official discord developer portal](https://discord.dev)
- rename "example.env" to ".env"
- install the necessary packages using one command: `npm install gcommands indomitable`
- run the bot with command: `npm run test`

## TESTING IF THE BOT WORKS

>If the bot has successfully turned on, then after inviting the bot to your discord server, the bot will be online.

>The bot has an automatically built-in `/ping` command that you can try.
